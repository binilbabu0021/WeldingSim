# WeldingSim

Name = Binil Manangadan Babu

The aim of my project is to simulate a basic welding setup. I have made a few canvas instructions inside the simulation to make it easier for the user.

I have tested it on Meta quest 3.

I have used a few 3d objects from sketchfab to increase the aesthetics. Namely mask, Gloves, Table,welding station with robot,chainbarrier,wallset, shelfpaint,door,arrow. they all are free to download. 

I have used Quick outline plugin,Hovl studio vfx,Stargeting plugins.

I have used a sound effect from pixabay. It Is loyalty free.

All of these were taken from Asset store.


Since I had limited time, my approach was to make it as simple as possible. After the collection of all the required materials, I Started with creating simple ui elements like the next button and the canvas. Thought about adding a few safety measures before welding. Implemented  it as simple as possible.my main aim was to make it simple, effective and user friendly.
